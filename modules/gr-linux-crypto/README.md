## What does this module do?

**gr-linux-crypto** is a GNU Radio module that connects GNU Radio applications to Linux-specific security features that aren't available in other cryptographic modules.

## Getting Started for Beginners

If you're new to cryptographic keys and wondering how to actually use this module, this section explains everything step-by-step.

### What Are GnuPG Keys?

**GnuPG keys** are cryptographic key pairs (public key + private key) used for:
- **Signing messages** (proving you sent them and they weren't modified)
- **Encrypting messages** (keeping them secret from unauthorized readers)
- **Verifying identity** (proving you are who you claim to be)

**Think of it like a lock and key:**
- **Public key** = Your lock (anyone can use it to encrypt messages for you or verify your signatures)
- **Private key** = Your key (only you have it, used to decrypt messages or create signatures)
- **PIN** = Password to protect your private key from being stolen

**GnuPG keys are files stored on your computer** (or on hardware devices like Nitrokey). They're created using the `gpg` command-line tool, and this module helps you use those keys in GNU Radio applications. GUI tools also exist - Nitrokey app supports Nitrokeys. The commands in this document show how it's done from the command line as examples. Please consult the `gpg` manual for complete set of commands.

### What is "Session Key Exchange"?

**Session key exchange** is how GnuPG securely shares encryption keys between people.

**The Problem:**
- Public-key encryption (like RSA) is slow and can only encrypt small amounts of data
- Symmetric encryption (like AES) is fast but requires both parties to have the same key
- How do you securely share that symmetric key?

**The Solution (Session Key Exchange):**
1. **You generate a random "session key"** (e.g., 256-bit AES key)
2. **You encrypt your message** with the fast session key
3. **You encrypt the session key** with the recipient's public key (slow but secure)
4. **You send both:** encrypted session key + encrypted message
5. **Recipient decrypts the session key** with their private key
6. **Recipient decrypts your message** with the session key

**Why "Session"?** Because each encrypted message uses a different random session key. This is more secure than reusing the same key.

**In SDR/GNU Radio context:** You might use this to securely exchange encryption keys over the air before starting encrypted communications, without having to encrypt all your radio data with slow public-key encryption.

### What is a "GnuPG Agent"?

**GnuPG agent** is a background program that manages your private keys securely.

**What it does:**
- Stores your private keys in memory (encrypted)
- Caches your PIN so you don't have to enter it repeatedly
- Handles PIN entry securely
- Protects keys from being accessed by unauthorized programs

**Why you need it:**
- Without the agent, every cryptographic operation would require you to enter your PIN
- The agent keeps keys loaded in memory for a limited time (configurable)
- After the timeout, you'll need to enter your PIN again

**Configuring Agent Timeout:**

For battery-powered devices that may be turned on/off frequently, you can configure longer timeouts so you only need to enter the PIN when the device is first powered on:

Edit `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:
```
# Cache PINs for specified time (in seconds)
# For a week: 7 days * 24 hours * 3600 seconds = 604800
default-cache-ttl 604800

# Maximum cache time (in seconds)
# For a month: 30 days * 24 hours * 3600 seconds = 2592000
max-cache-ttl 2592000

# Pinentry program (GUI for PIN entry)
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
```

After editing, reload the agent:
```bash
gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
```

**Timeout values:**
- `default-cache-ttl`: Time before PIN is required again (default: 3600 = 1 hour)
- `max-cache-ttl`: Maximum time PIN can be cached (default: 7200 = 2 hours)
- For a week: `604800` seconds
- For a month: `2592000` seconds (30 days)

**Note:** Longer timeouts reduce security but improve usability for battery-powered devices. The PIN will still be required when the device is first powered on or after the timeout expires.

**How to start it:**
```bash
# Usually starts automatically, but you can start it manually:
gpg-agent --daemon
```

**In this module:** The module uses GnuPG agent to access your keys, which reduces the need for constant PIN entry. However, **this module does NOT include a GUI, keypad, or touchscreen interface** for PIN entry. The standard pinentry programs (pinentry-gtk-2, pinentry-qt, etc.) work for desktop use, but if you need custom PIN entry interfaces (alphanumeric keypad, touchscreen, etc.) for your GNU Radio application, you must implement them yourself using the guidelines in the [GnuPG Integration Guide](docs/gnupg_integration.md).

### What Are "Pinentry Programs"?

**Pinentry programs** are graphical or text-based programs that securely prompt you for your PIN.

**What they do:**
- Display a secure dialog box asking for your PIN
- Protect your PIN from being intercepted by other programs
- Support different interfaces: GUI (graphical), terminal (text), or curses (ncurses)

**Common pinentry programs:**
- `pinentry-gtk-2` - Graphical dialog (recommended for desktop)
- `pinentry-qt` - Qt-based graphical dialog
- `pinentry-curses` - Terminal-based (for SSH sessions)
- `pinentry-tty` - Plain text terminal (less secure, not recommended)

**Why you need them:**
- When using hardware keys (Nitrokey, YubiKey), the PIN is required for every operation
- Pinentry provides a secure way to enter your PIN without other programs seeing it
- Prevents malware from intercepting your PIN

**How to configure:**
Edit `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:
```
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
```

**In this module:** When you use GnuPG features with hardware keys, the standard pinentry programs will prompt you for your PIN. If you need custom PIN entry interfaces (alphanumeric keypad, touchscreen, etc.) integrated into your GNU Radio application, see the [GnuPG Integration Guide](docs/gnupg_integration.md) for implementation guidelines and example code.

### How to Create a GnuPG Key

**Step 1: Generate your key pair**
```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

**Step 2: Follow the prompts:**
1. **Key type:** Choose "RSA and RSA" (recommended) or "ECC" (modern, smaller keys)
2. **Key size:** Choose 3072 or 4096 bits (higher is more secure, slower)
3. **Expiration:** Choose how long the key is valid (or "Key does not expire")
4. **Your name:** Enter your real name or callsign
5. **Email:** Enter your email address
6. **Comment:** Optional (e.g., "Amateur Radio Callsign: KG7ABC")
7. **Passphrase:** Enter a strong passphrase (this protects your private key)

**Step 3: Verify your key was created**
```bash
# List your keys
gpg --list-keys        # Shows public keys
gpg --list-secret-keys # Shows private keys
```

**Example output:**
```
/home/user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
-------------------------------------
pub   rsa3072 2024-01-15 [SC]
      ABC123DEF4567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12
uid           [ultimate] John Doe <john@example.com>
sub   rsa3072 2024-01-15 [E]
```

**Step 4: Export your public key (to share with others)**
```bash
gpg --export --armor john@example.com > my_public_key.asc
# Share this file - it's safe to share publicly
```

**Your private key stays on your computer** - never share it!

### Advanced Key Management: Centralized Key Generation and Distribution

For organizations, teams, or groups that need to manage multiple users, a centralized key management approach can provide better security and easier administration.

**How It Works:**

1. **Primary Key Generation (Secure System)**
   - One trusted individual generates a primary PGP key on a secure, isolated system
   - The primary key pair includes the master key and multiple subkeys
   - The primary key is kept extremely secure (never leaves the secure system)
   - This centralizes key generation under controlled, secure conditions

2. **Subkey Export and Distribution**
   - After creation, individual subkeys are exported from the secure system
   - Each subkey is securely transferred to individual Nitrokey devices or GnuPG cards
   - Each user receives their own hardware device (Nitrokey or GnuPG card) with a pre-loaded subkey
   - Users never handle the primary key generation process

**Security Benefits:**

- **Centralized Control**: Key generation happens in a controlled, secure environment
- **Simplified Onboarding**: New users receive pre-loaded hardware devices - no complex key generation process required
- **Reduced Risk**: Users don't directly handle key generation, reducing the chance of mistakes or key compromise
- **Consistent Security**: All keys are generated with the same security parameters and best practices

**Backup and Redundancy:**

- This system works with multiple Nitrokey devices and GnuPG cards
- Users can have backup devices (extra Nitrokey devices, GnuPG cards) with the same or different subkeys
- If one device is lost or damaged, the backup device can be used immediately
- Multiple devices provide redundancy for critical operations

**Use Cases:**

- **Amateur Radio Clubs**: One trusted administrator generates keys, distributes Nitrokey devices to club members
- **Research Teams**: Centralized key management for collaborative projects
- **Emergency Services**: Pre-configured hardware devices for rapid deployment
- **Any organization**: Where centralized security control is preferred over individual key generation

**Important Notes:**

- The primary key must be stored in an extremely secure location (air-gapped system, secure vault)
- Subkey export and transfer to hardware devices must be done securely
- Users still protect their devices with PINs (recommended minimum 5 characters)
- Consult the `gpg` manual for complete instructions on key generation, subkey creation, and export procedures

This approach provides enterprise-grade key management while maintaining the security benefits of hardware-backed keys.

### Web of Trust and Key Signing Parties

OpenPGP and GnuPG use a decentralized trust model called the **web of trust** to verify the identity of key owners and establish trust in public keys.

**What is the Web of Trust?**

All OpenPGP-compliant implementations include a certificate vetting scheme to assist with verifying key ownership; its operation has been termed a **web of trust**. OpenPGP certificates (which include one or more public keys along with owner information) can be digitally signed by other users who, by that act, endorse the association of that public key with the person or entity listed in the certificate.

**How It Works:**

1. **Key Distribution**: You distribute your public key (the one you generated with `gpg --full-generate-key`)
2. **Identity Verification**: Others verify that the public key actually belongs to you (they confirm your identity in person or through other trusted means)
3. **Key Signing**: Once confident, they digitally sign your public key certificate using their own private key
4. **Trust Building**: Each signature on your key adds to the "web of trust" - others who trust the signer may also trust your key

**Key Signing Parties:**

A **key signing party** is an event at which people present their public keys to others in person. At these events:

- Participants meet face-to-face to verify each other's identity
- Each person confirms the identity of others (checking ID cards, business cards, or other proof)
- Once identity is verified, participants digitally sign each other's public key certificates
- This creates a network of trust - if Alice trusts Bob and Bob signed Charlie's key, Alice may trust Charlie's key

**Why Key Signing Parties Matter:**

- **In-Person Verification**: Physical presence allows stronger identity verification than online methods
- **Trust Network**: Builds a web of trust that extends beyond direct relationships
- **Community Building**: Common practice in amateur radio, open source communities, and cryptography conferences
- **Security**: Reduces the risk of accepting fake or compromised keys

**Common Workflow at a Key Signing Party:**

Although PGP keys are generally used with personal computers for Internet-related applications, key signing parties themselves generally do not involve computers, since that would give adversaries increased opportunities for subterfuge. The workflow typically follows this pattern:

1. **Before the Event**: Generate your key fingerprint (not the full key)
   ```bash
   # Get your key fingerprint
   gpg --fingerprint YOUR_KEY_ID
   ```
   - The fingerprint is a string of letters and numbers created by a cryptographic hash function
   - It condenses your public key down to a shorter, more manageable string
   - Write down or print your fingerprint to bring to the event
   - Example fingerprint: `ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 90AB CDEF 1234 5678 90AB CDEF`

2. **At the Event (No Computers)**: 
   - Participants meet in person and exchange **fingerprints only** (not full public keys)
   - Write down the fingerprints of participants whose identity you verify
   - Verify each person's identity (check ID cards, government-issued identification, business cards, or other proof)
   - Confirm that the fingerprint matches the person's claimed identity
   - The absence of computers prevents attackers from swapping keys or performing other attacks during the event

3. **After the Event**:
   - Obtain the full public keys corresponding to the fingerprints you received
   - You can search for keys on keyservers using the fingerprint or email/name
   - Verify that the fingerprint of the key you downloaded matches what was exchanged at the party
   - Sign the public keys of people whose identity you verified at the event
   - Upload your signed public key to keyservers so others can benefit from the web of trust

**Why Use Fingerprints Instead of Full Keys at the Event?**

- **Security**: Prevents attackers from swapping keys on computers during the event
- **Simplicity**: Fingerprints are short strings that can be written down or printed
- **Verification**: After obtaining the full key, you can verify the fingerprint matches
- **Trust**: In-person fingerprint exchange combined with identity verification builds stronger trust

**In Amateur Radio Context:**

- Operators can meet at hamfests, club meetings, or special events
- Verify each other's callsigns and identity
- Sign each other's GnuPG keys to build a trusted network
- This helps verify digital signatures on radio transmissions and messages
- Creates cryptographic proof of callsign ownership

### Key servers - what are those?

Keyservers are distributed databases that store and synchronize public PGP/GPG keys across the internet. They enable the web of trust by making public keys discoverable and allowing people to find and verify keys from others around the world.

**How Keyservers Work:**

1. **Distributed Network**: Keyservers form a peer-to-peer network that automatically synchronizes public keys
   - When you upload a key to one keyserver, it propagates to other keyservers in the network
   - Keyserver networks (like the SKS keyserver pool) sync updates between peers
   - This ensures keys are available from multiple locations, providing redundancy and availability

2. **Synchronization**: Keyservers continuously synchronize with each other
   - Updates to keys (new keys, revocations, signatures) are propagated across the network
   - The sync process ensures that keys uploaded to one server become available on others
   - This creates a distributed, resilient system where no single point of failure exists

3. **Public Read Access**: Anyone can search and download public keys
   - Public keys are meant to be shared - they contain no secret information
   - Keyservers allow searching by email address, key ID, or fingerprint
   - This enables the web of trust by making signed keys discoverable

4. **Privacy Considerations**: 
   - Public keys are public by design - they cannot be deleted from keyservers
   - Email addresses and user IDs in public keys are permanently associated with the key
   - Upload revocation certificates if you need to invalidate a key
   - Be aware that keyserver data is permanent and publicly accessible

5. **Keyserver Mesh Network**: 
   - Keyservers form a mesh network where they peer with each other
   - You can view a graph of the keyserver network showing synchronization relationships at: [https://spider.pgpkeys.eu/graphs/](https://spider.pgpkeys.eu/graphs/)
   - For a detailed list of SKS peer servers with status, IP addresses, versions, and connectivity information, see: [https://spider.pgpkeys.eu/sks-peers](https://spider.pgpkeys.eu/sks-peers)
   - These visualizations show which keyservers are connected and synchronizing with each other
   - The graph and peer list help understand the distributed nature of the keyserver infrastructure

**Using Keyservers:**

After signing keys, you can upload them to public keyservers (like `keys.openpgp.org`):
```bash
# Upload your signed key to a keyserver
gpg --send-keys YOUR_KEY_ID

# Search for keys on a keyserver
gpg --search-keys email@example.com

# Refresh keys from keyservers
gpg --refresh-keys
```

**Common Keyservers:**

- `keys.openpgp.org` - Modern keyserver with privacy features
- `pgp.mit.edu` - MIT keyserver (legacy SKS network)
- `pool.sks-keyservers.net` - Pool of SKS keyservers

**Best Practices:**

- Upload your public key to a keyserver after creating it
- Upload signed keys after key signing parties to contribute to the web of trust
- Use `gpg --refresh-keys` periodically to update keys you have imported
- Revoke keys immediately if compromised, then upload the revocation certificate

**Important Notes:**

- Key signing is about **verifying identity**, not about encryption strength
- Sign only keys when you are confident of the owner's identity
- A signed key indicates: "I have verified this key belongs to this person"
- The web of trust helps others decide whether to trust a key they haven't personally verified
- This is a social/cryptographic hybrid approach to building trust networks

For complete instructions on key signing, key distribution, and managing the web of trust, consult the `gpg` manual and GnuPG documentation.

### What to Do With a GnuPG Key

**1. Sign Messages (Digital Signatures)**
```bash
# Sign a message/file
echo "Hello world" | gpg --clearsign > message.sig
# Creates a readable message with signature attached
```

**2. Encrypt Messages**
```bash
# Encrypt for a recipient (they need your public key)
echo "Secret message" | gpg --encrypt --recipient recipient@example.com > encrypted.asc
```

**3. In GNU Radio / SDR Context:**

**Example: Signing radio transmissions**
```python
from gr_linux_crypto.python.m17_frame import M17SessionKeyExchange

# Sign a message to prove your identity
message = b"Repeater config: adjust squelch to -120 dBm"
sender_key_id = "0xABCD1234"  # Your GnuPG key ID

signed = M17SessionKeyExchange.sign_key_offer(message, sender_key_id)
# Send signed message over radio
# Receiver verifies signature to confirm it came from you
```

**Example: Secure key exchange for encrypted communications**
```python
# 1. Generate session key for AES encryption
session_key = M17SessionKeyExchange.generate_session_key()

# 2. Encrypt session key with recipient's GnuPG public key
recipient_key_id = "0x5678EFAB"
encrypted_key = M17SessionKeyExchange.encrypt_key_for_recipient(
    session_key, 
    recipient_key_id
)

# 3. Send encrypted key over radio (or secure channel)
# 4. Recipient decrypts session key with their private key
# 5. Both parties now have the same session key for AES encryption
```

### GnuPG vs Brainpool ECC: When to Use Which?

**Use GnuPG when:**
- You want **interoperability** with existing email/software tools
- You need **OpenPGP standard compliance** (widely supported)
- You want to **integrate with existing key infrastructure** (keyservers, web of trust)
- You prefer **proven, battle-tested software** (GnuPG has been around since 1999)
- You're working with **email encryption or file signing** (standard uses of GnuPG)

**Use Brainpool ECC when:**
- You want **algorithm diversity** (avoid NSA-influenced algorithms)
- You need **smaller key sizes** for the same security level
- You're building **custom cryptographic protocols** in GNU Radio
- You want **direct integration** with GNU Radio blocks (no subprocess calls)
- You're doing **real-time SDR encryption/signing** (Brainpool is implemented as GNU Radio blocks)

**Example: When to use each**

**Use GnuPG:**
- Signing software releases for distribution
- Signing emails with amateur radio contacts
- Key exchange with people who already have GnuPG keys
- Integration with existing OpenPGP infrastructure

**Use Brainpool ECC:**
- Real-time radio encryption in GNU Radio flowgraphs
- Custom digital signature protocol for repeater control
- Direct ECDH key exchange in GNU Radio applications
- When you need cryptographic operations as GNU Radio blocks (not subprocess calls)

**You can use both:** You might use GnuPG for initial key exchange (off-air), then use Brainpool ECC for on-air communications.

### How It Fits Into Your SDR Workflow

**Typical SDR cryptographic workflow:**

**Step 1: Key Management (Off-Air)**
```bash
# Create your GnuPG key
gpg --full-generate-key

# Exchange public keys with contacts (off-air: email, website, keyserver)
gpg --import contact_public_key.asc
```

**Step 2: Session Key Exchange (Initial Setup)**
```python
# In your GNU Radio Python script
from gr_linux_crypto.python.m17_frame import M17SessionKeyExchange

# Exchange encryption keys securely (using GnuPG)
session_key = M17SessionKeyExchange.generate_session_key()
encrypted_key = M17SessionKeyExchange.encrypt_key_for_recipient(
    session_key, 
    recipient_key_id
)
# Send encrypted_key over a secure channel or initial radio contact
```

**Step 3: Store Keys Securely**
```python
# Store session key in kernel keyring (secure, Linux-specific)
from gr_linux_crypto.python.keyring_helper import KeyringHelper
helper = KeyringHelper()
key_id = helper.add_key('user', 'session_key', session_key)
```

**Step 4: Use Keys for Real-Time Operations**
```python
# Load key from kernel keyring into GNU Radio flowgraph
from gnuradio import linux_crypto, blocks

tb = gr.top_block()

# Load key from secure storage
key_source = linux_crypto.kernel_keyring_source(key_id=key_id)

# Encrypt radio data in real-time
encryptor = linux_crypto.kernel_crypto_aes(
    mode='gcm',
    encrypt=True
)

# Connect: radio data -> encryption -> transmission
tb.connect(radio_source, encryptor, transmitter)
```

**Step 5: Digital Signatures for Authentication**
```python
# Sign repeater control commands
message = b"SET_SQUELCH -120"
signature = M17SessionKeyExchange.sign_key_offer(message, sender_key_id)
# Send message + signature over radio
# Repeater verifies signature before executing command
```

**Complete Flow Example:**
```
1. Off-Air: Exchange GnuPG public keys (email/website)
2. Off-Air: Exchange session key (encrypted with GnuPG)
3. Secure Storage: Store session key in kernel keyring (via gr-linux-crypto)
4. On-Air: Use session key for real-time AES encryption (via gr-linux-crypto blocks)
5. On-Air: Sign commands with GnuPG (via gr-linux-crypto Python helpers)
6. Verification: Receivers verify signatures and decrypt with session key
```

**Why this workflow?**
- **GnuPG** handles secure key exchange (slow but secure, done once)
- **Kernel keyring** provides secure key storage (Linux-specific feature)
- **GNU Radio blocks** provide real-time encryption/signing (fast, for continuous radio data)
- **Brainpool ECC** provides algorithm diversity (avoid NSA-influenced algorithms)

This combines the best of all worlds: proven key exchange (GnuPG), secure storage (kernel keyring), and real-time performance (GNU Radio blocks).

### Simple Explanation

Think of it like this:
- **gr-openssl** = Standard cryptographic operations (AES, RSA, SHA, etc.)
- **gr-nacl** = Modern cryptography (X25519, Ed25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- **gr-linux-crypto** = Linux-only security infrastructure (kernel keyring, hardware keys, kernel crypto API)

**gr-linux-crypto doesn't duplicate what gr-openssl and gr-nacl already do.** Instead, it provides the "glue" to use Linux-specific security features with those existing modules.

### What Makes This Module Special?

1. **Secure Key Storage in the Linux Kernel**
   - Stores cryptographic keys inside the Linux kernel (not in regular files)
   - Keys are protected by the kernel, making them harder to steal
   - Works with existing crypto modules (gr-openssl, gr-nacl) as a secure key source

2. **Hardware Security Device Support**
   - Supports Nitrokey and other hardware security devices
   - Store keys on physical hardware tokens instead of software
   - Keys can't be copied or stolen if the computer is compromised

3. **Direct Kernel Crypto Access**
   - Uses the Linux kernel's built-in cryptographic functions
   - Can be faster than user-space crypto libraries
   - Leverages hardware acceleration when available

### Real-World Example

**Before gr-linux-crypto:**
```
GNU Radio → gr-openssl → (keys stored in files or memory - vulnerable)
```

**With gr-linux-crypto:**
```
GNU Radio → gr-linux-crypto (loads key from kernel/hardware) → gr-openssl → (secure!)
```

### Who Should Use This Module?

- **Amateur radio operators** who need secure key management for digital signatures
- **Radio experimenters** working with encrypted communications
- **Security-conscious developers** who want hardware-backed key storage
- **Anyone** who needs to use Linux kernel security features in GNU Radio

### Quick Start Idea

Instead of loading an encryption key from a file (which could be stolen), you can:
- Store the key in the Linux kernel keyring (via gr-linux-crypto)
- Or store it on a Nitrokey hardware device (via gr-linux-crypto)
- Then use that secure key with gr-openssl or gr-nacl for actual encryption

### How Keys Work and What They're Used For

This module supports cryptographic keys that enable two main functions: **digital signatures** and **encryption**. Understanding the difference is crucial.

#### Digital Signatures: Proving Identity and Integrity

**Key Pairs (Public/Private Keys):**
- You generate a **public/private key pair** linked to your identity (name, email, callsign)
- The **private key** is secret - you keep it secure and never share it
- The **public key** is shared openly - others use it to verify your signatures

**PIN Protection:**
- Private keys are protected with a PIN (Personal Identification Number)
- PIN supports both **numbers and letters** for stronger security
- **Recommended minimum PIN length: 5 characters** (but longer is better)
- The PIN prevents unauthorized use even if someone gains access to your key storage
- Choose a strong PIN that you can remember but others can't easily guess

**How Signing Works:**
1. **Signing**: You sign messages or files with your **private key**, creating a unique cryptographic signature
2. **Verification**: Others use your **public key** to verify the signature, which proves:
   - **Authentication**: The message came from you (not an imposter)
   - **Integrity**: The message hasn't been altered since you signed it

**Important: Signing and Encrypting Are Separate Operations**
- **Signature only**: Message is readable by anyone, but the signature proves authenticity and integrity (like a wax seal on an open letter)
- **Encryption only**: Message is secret, but no proof of who sent it
- **Both together**: You can sign AND encrypt the same message for privacy + authentication

**Security Model:**
The security relies on keeping your private key secret while distributing your public key widely. Anyone can verify your signatures with your public key, but only you can create signatures with your private key.

#### Real-World Use Cases

**1. Callsign Verification (Amateur Radio)**
- Verify your callsign identity through digital signatures
- When you sign transmissions with your private key, recipients can verify with your public key
- Prevents callsign spoofing - cryptographic proof that the transmission came from the legitimate callsign holder
- More secure than traditional authentication methods (DTMF codes, etc.)
- Example: Signed transmissions prove "This message is from KG7ABC, verified cryptographically" - prevents someone from impersonating your callsign

**2. Remote Repeater Configuration (Amateur Radio)**
- Sign messages to remotely configure repeater settings (squelch, frequency adjustments, etc.)
- Very secure: The repeater software verifies your signature before accepting commands
- Messages are NOT encrypted, just validated - so the commands are readable but authenticated
- **Benefit**: No need to physically visit the repeater site in harsh conditions (wind, snow, -25°C) just to fix settings
- Example: "Adjust squelch to -120 dBm" - signed by authorized operator, verified by repeater software

**3. Physical Access Control (Door Locks)**
- If a door lock system supports GnuPG/PGP, you can use signed commands to unlock doors
- The lock verifies your signature before granting access
- More secure than traditional keys or keycards - cryptographic proof of identity

**4. Software Releases and Updates**
- Sign software releases to prove the developer published them
- Users verify signatures before installing, preventing tampering
- Prevents malicious code injection

**5. Public Announcements**
- Sign public messages to prove authenticity
- Useful for emergency communications, network updates, or official statements
- Everyone can read the message, but only the legitimate sender could have signed it

**6. Git Commits and Code Integrity**
- Sign Git commits to prove who wrote the code
- Prevents code injection attacks and proves authorship

**7. Email Authentication**
- Sign emails where privacy isn't needed but authenticity matters
- Recipients verify with your public key, confirming you (not an imposter) sent that exact message

**8. Website and Web Service Authentication**
- Use your private key to authenticate to websites and web services supporting public key authentication
- More secure than passwords - cryptographic proof of identity
- Websites verify your identity using your public key
- Examples: Git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab), cloud services, secure web portals
- Your private key (protected by PIN) proves your identity without transmitting passwords

**9. SSH Connection Authentication**
- Authenticate to remote servers using SSH key pairs
- Replace password-based SSH login with key-based authentication
- Your private key (protected by PIN) proves your identity to the server
- Server verifies your connection using your public key
- Much more secure than password authentication - prevents brute force attacks and password interception
- Commonly used for secure server administration and remote access

**10. File, Disk, and Full-Disk Encryption (LUKS)**
- Encrypt and decrypt files using your cryptographic keys
- Encrypt entire disk partitions or storage devices
- Full-disk encryption using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)
- Protect sensitive data at rest - files and disks remain encrypted when system is powered off
- Use your securely stored keys (from kernel keyring or hardware device) to unlock encrypted volumes
- Example use cases:
  - Encrypt laptop hard drives to protect data if device is lost or stolen
  - Encrypt external USB drives for secure portable storage
  - Encrypt individual files containing sensitive information
  - Full system encryption protects all data including operating system
- Keys can be stored on Nitrokey hardware device or kernel keyring for additional security

**Important Note for Full-Disk Encryption:**
- **The computer will NOT boot without the key present** (hardware device must be plugged in)
- Boot process stops at a black screen prompting for the key and PIN
- No access to the operating system or any data without the proper key and PIN
- This provides maximum security: Even physical access to the computer is useless without the key
- Make sure you have backup keys or recovery methods to avoid permanent data loss
- Please consult https://docs.nitrokey.com/nitrokeys/features/openpgp-card/hard-disk-encryption/luks

**11. Linux Package and Update Verification**
- Linux and its variants use cryptographic signatures to verify system files and software updates
- Package managers (apt, yum, pacman, etc.) verify package signatures before installation
- Ensures that no one has meddled with files or tampered with downloaded software updates
- Prevents installation of malicious or corrupted packages
- System files are signed and verified to detect unauthorized modifications
- Example: When you run `apt update` or install packages, the system verifies the package signatures
- If a signature doesn't match, the package is rejected - protecting against supply chain attacks
- This is why you see "W: GPG error" messages if repository keys are missing or expired
- Maintains system integrity by ensuring only authentic, untampered software is installed

**Common Pattern for Signing Without Encryption:**
```
1. You create a message/command
2. You sign it with your private key
3. You send the message + signature
4. Recipient verifies signature with your public key
5. If verification succeeds: Message is trusted (authentic and unaltered)
6. If verification fails: Message is rejected (possible forgery or tampering)
```

**Example Flow:**
- You sign an email with your private key
- Recipients verify with your public key
- Verification confirms you (not an imposter) sent that exact message
- The email content is readable by anyone, but the signature proves it came from you

**Bottom line:** This module is about **where and how keys are stored securely**, not about implementing encryption algorithms (those are in gr-openssl and gr-nacl). However, it enables you to use those securely stored keys for both **digital signatures** (proving identity and message integrity) and **encryption** (keeping messages secret).

## What This Module Provides (Unique Features)

### 1. **Kernel Keyring Integration**
- **Unique to Linux**: Direct integration with Linux kernel keyring
- **Secure key storage**: Keys protected by kernel, not user space

## What This Module Does NOT Provide (Avoiding Duplication)

### **Basic OpenSSL Operations (Use gr-openssl)**

**What gr-openssl provides:**
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES (all key sizes and modes), DES, 3DES, Blowfish, Camellia
- **Hashing**: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, MD5
- **HMAC**: Message authentication codes
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: RSA encryption/decryption, RSA signing/verification
- **Additional ECC Curves**: NIST curves (P-256, P-384, P-521), secp256k1
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2, scrypt
- **OpenSSL EVP API**: Comprehensive OpenSSL cryptographic operations

**Example using gr-openssl:**
```python
from gnuradio import gr, crypto, linux_crypto

# Use gr-openssl for AES encryption
tb = gr.top_block()
key = [0x01] * 32  # 256-bit key
iv = [0x02] * 16   # 128-bit IV
cipher_desc = crypto.sym_ciph_desc("aes-256-cbc", key, iv)
encryptor = crypto.sym_enc(cipher_desc)

# Use gr-openssl for SHA-256 hashing
hasher = crypto.hash("sha256")

# Use gr-openssl for RSA operations
rsa_encryptor = crypto.rsa_encrypt(public_key)
rsa_decryptor = crypto.rsa_decrypt(private_key)

# Optional: Use gr-linux-crypto kernel keyring as key source
keyring_src = linux_crypto.kernel_keyring_source(key_id=12345)
tb.connect(keyring_src, encryptor)
```

**Note**: The above API calls are conceptual examples. Consult gr-openssl documentation for exact function names and signatures.

**gr-linux-crypto integration**: Provides kernel keyring as secure key source for gr-openssl blocks.

### **Modern Crypto (NaCl/libsodium) - Use gr-nacl**

**What gr-nacl provides:**
- **Curve25519/X25519**: Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange
  - Fast, secure key exchange
  - 256-bit security level
  - High performance on modern CPUs
- **Ed25519**: Elliptic curve digital signatures
  - Deterministic signatures
  - Fast signing and verification
  - 128-bit security level
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Authenticated encryption
  - Stream cipher with authentication
  - AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
  - RFC 8439 compliant
  - High performance, especially on ARM processors

**Example using gr-nacl:**
```python
from gnuradio import gr, nacl, linux_crypto

# Use gr-nacl for Curve25519/X25519 key exchange
tb = gr.top_block()

# X25519 key exchange (gr-nacl supports X25519)
alice_private = nacl.generate_private_key_curve25519()
alice_public = nacl.generate_public_key_curve25519(alice_private)
bob_private = nacl.generate_private_key_curve25519()
bob_public = nacl.generate_public_key_curve25519(bob_private)

# Shared secret via X25519
alice_shared = nacl.dh_curve25519(alice_private, bob_public)
bob_shared = nacl.dh_curve25519(bob_private, alice_public)
# alice_shared == bob_shared

# Use Ed25519 for digital signatures
message = b"Important message"
signature = nacl.sign_ed25519(message, alice_private)
is_valid = nacl.verify_ed25519(message, signature, alice_public)

# Use ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption
nonce = nacl.generate_nonce()
encrypted = nacl.encrypt_chacha20poly1305(message, alice_shared, nonce)
decrypted = nacl.decrypt_chacha20poly1305(encrypted, bob_shared, nonce)

# Optional: Use gr-linux-crypto Nitrokey for secure key storage
nitrokey_src = linux_crypto.nitrokey_interface(slot=1)
# Connect nitrokey key to nacl operations
```

**Note**: The above API calls are conceptual examples. Consult gr-nacl documentation for exact function names and signatures.

**gr-linux-crypto integration**: Provides hardware security modules (Nitrokey, kernel keyring) as secure key storage for gr-nacl operations.

**Why not duplicate?**
- gr-openssl and gr-nacl are mature, well-tested modules
- Avoiding duplication reduces maintenance burden
- Focus gr-linux-crypto on unique Linux-specific features

### **GnuPG/OpenPGP Operations**
- **Limited integration**: Provides subprocess-based GnuPG wrapper for session key exchange
- **GnuPG card support**: Supports OpenPGP smart cards (including YubiKey, Nitrokey Pro/Storage in OpenPGP mode) through GnuPG - cards work automatically if GnuPG can detect them (see [GnuPG SmartCard Wiki](https://wiki.gnupg.org/SmartCard) for card setup and usage, [OpenPGP Smart Card V3.4](https://www.floss-shop.de/en/security-privacy/smartcards/13/openpgp-smart-card-v3.4) product page)
- **PIN handling**: Uses GnuPG agent and pinentry programs (see [Getting Started for Beginners](#getting-started-for-beginners) for explanations)
- **Not native blocks**: Python utilities only, not stream-processing blocks
- **See**: [GnuPG Integration Guide](docs/gnupg_integration.md) for advanced setup, PIN handling, smart card configuration, and usage patterns

**What is GnuPG?**

GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a hybrid encryption system that combines two types of cryptography:

1. **Symmetric-key encryption** - Fast encryption using the same key for both encrypting and decrypting. Used for the actual message data because it's fast.
2. **Public-key encryption** - Secure key exchange using separate public and private keys. Used to securely share the symmetric key.

**How it works:**

Instead of encrypting the entire message with slow public-key encryption, GnuPG:
- Generates a random "session key" (symmetric)
- Encrypts your message with the fast session key
- Encrypts the session key with the recipient's public key
- Sends both: encrypted session key + encrypted message

The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the session key, then uses the session key to decrypt your message. This gives you both speed (from symmetric encryption) and secure key exchange (from public-key encryption).

GnuPG also supports digital signatures to verify who sent a message and that it wasn't changed. It follows the OpenPGP standard, which is widely used for email encryption.

**For beginners:** See [Getting Started for Beginners](#getting-started-for-beginners) for detailed explanations of:
- What GnuPG keys are and how to create them
- What "session key exchange" means
- What "GnuPG agent" and "pinentry programs" are
- How to use GnuPG keys in GNU Radio / SDR workflows
- When to use GnuPG vs Brainpool ECC

**See**: [Legal Considerations](#legal-considerations) section for important legal information about using cryptographic features.

## Legal Considerations

### **Legal and Appropriate Uses for Amateur Radio**

1. **Digital Signatures (Primary Use Case)**
   - Cryptographically sign transmissions to verify sender identity
   - Prevent callsign spoofing
   - Replace error-prone DTMF authentication
   - **Legal**: Digital signatures do not obscure content and are generally permitted

2. **Message Integrity**
   - Detect transmission errors
   - Verify message authenticity
   - Non-obscuring authentication tags
   - **Legal**: Integrity verification does not hide message content

3. **Key Management Infrastructure**
   - Secure key storage (Nitrokey, kernel keyring)
   - Off-air key exchange (ECDH)
   - Authentication key distribution
   - **Legal**: Key management does not encrypt on-air content

### **Experimental and Research Uses**

For experiments or research on frequencies where encryption is legally permitted:
- Encryption may be used in accordance with local regulations
- Users must verify applicable frequency bands and regulations
- This module provides the technical capability; users are responsible for legal compliance

### **User Responsibility and Disclaimer**

**Critical:** Users must check local regulations before using cryptographic features.

- **Encryption regulations vary by country and jurisdiction**
  - Different countries have different rules regarding encryption
  - Some jurisdictions prohibit encryption on certain frequency bands
  - Amateur radio regulations typically prohibit obscuring message content

- **Frequency bands have different rules**
  - Amateur radio bands: Generally prohibit message encryption (signatures and integrity checks usually permitted)
  - ISM bands: Varies by jurisdiction
  - Experimental allocations: May permit encryption with proper authorization

- **The responsibility for legal compliance is 100% the user's**
  - This module and its developers assume no liability for improper use
  - Users must understand and comply with all applicable regulations
  - Ignorance of regulations is not a valid defense

- **Consult with local regulatory authorities**
  - **United States**: Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
  - **United Kingdom**: Office of Communications (OFCOM)
  - **Other jurisdictions**: Contact your local telecommunications/radio regulatory authority

**Disclaimer of Liability:**

This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The developers and contributors of this module:
- Make no representation about the legal status of cryptographic operations in your jurisdiction
- Assume no liability for misuse, illegal use, or violation of regulations
- Do not provide legal advice
- Strongly recommend consulting with legal counsel or regulatory authorities before using cryptographic features

**It is your responsibility to ensure all use of this software complies with applicable laws and regulations.**

## What happens if I remove my Nitrokey or GnuPG card?

**Important Security Behavior:**

When you remove a Nitrokey device or GnuPG smart card during operation, the module automatically detects the disconnection and **immediately clears all cached key data from memory**.

**Nitrokey (Password Safe Slots):**
- The module periodically checks if the Nitrokey device is still connected (every 1000 work() function calls)
- If disconnection is detected, all cached key data is immediately and securely cleared from memory
- The block will output zeros until the device is reconnected and keys are reloaded
- **Security**: Keys stored in password safe slots are removed from the computer's memory when the device is unplugged

**Kernel Keyring:**
- The module periodically checks if the key still exists in the kernel keyring (every 1000 work() function calls)
- If the key is removed from the keyring, all cached key data is immediately and securely cleared from memory
- The block will output zeros until the key is re-added to the keyring
- **Security**: Keys are removed from the computer's memory when removed from the keyring

**GnuPG Card (OpenPGP Smart Card):**
- Private keys stored on GnuPG cards (including Nitrokey in OpenPGP mode) **never leave the card**
- GnuPG operations require the physical card to be present
- If the card is removed, subsequent cryptographic operations will fail until the card is reinserted
- **Security**: Private keys cannot be extracted from the card - they remain secure even if the card is removed

**Summary:**
- **Nitrokey Password Safe**: Keys are cleared from memory when device is removed
- **Kernel Keyring**: Keys are cleared from memory when removed from keyring
- **GnuPG Card**: Keys never leave the card, so removal simply prevents operations

This ensures that removing your hardware security device also removes the keys from the computer's memory, providing protection against unauthorized access if the device is removed while the system is running.

## Why Nitrokey?

**Firmware Updates Enable Future-Proof Security:**

Nitrokey devices support firmware updates, which is a significant advantage over YubiKeys and GnuPG cards that do not have this function.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Firmware Updates**: Nitrokey devices can be updated with new firmware versions
- **Access to New Ciphers**: By updating the firmware, you gain access to new cryptographic algorithms and ciphers
- **No Need for New Hardware**: Unlike YubiKeys and GnuPG cards, you don't need to purchase a new device to support new cryptographic standards
- **Future-Proof**: As new cryptographic algorithms are developed and standardized, firmware updates allow your Nitrokey to support them
- **Tamper Protection**: Nitrokeys have protection from attempts at tampering, providing additional physical security

**Comparison:**
- **Nitrokey**: Supports firmware updates - can add new ciphers via software update
- **YubiKey**: No firmware updates - requires new hardware for new cipher support
- **GnuPG Cards**: No firmware updates - fixed functionality, cannot add new ciphers

This makes Nitrokey a more flexible and future-proof choice for long-term cryptographic security needs, as you can adapt to evolving security standards without replacing hardware.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Don't Duplicate - Integrate!**
- **Use `gr-openssl`** for: AES, SHA, RSA, and other OpenSSL operations
- **Use `gr-nacl`** for: X25519 (Curve25519 key exchange), Ed25519 signatures, ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Add thin wrappers** in gr-linux-crypto for: kernel keyring, hardware security modules, kernel crypto API

### 2. **Leverage Existing Tools**
- `keyctl` command for kernel keyring management
- `libnitrokey` for hardware security modules
- Existing GNU Radio crypto infrastructure

### 3. **Focus on What's Missing**
- **Kernel keyring integration** (not in existing modules)
- **Hardware security module bridges** (Nitrokey, TPM)
- **GNU Radio-specific helpers** (PDU crypto, stream crypto)

## Usage Flowchart

See [Usage Flowchart](docs/USAGE_FLOWCHART.md) for a detailed flowchart showing how to integrate gr-linux-crypto with gr-openssl and gr-nacl.

## Usage Examples

- [Signing and Verification Examples](examples/SIGNING_VERIFICATION_README.md) - GRC examples for digital signing and verification with Nitrokey and kernel keyring

### Inline Signatures Work For

**M17, PSK, MFSK, APRS (flexible formats)** - Modes where you can modify the frame structure, and the length of the frames is not critical.

### For FT8, FT4, WSPR (WSJT-X modes)

**Any fixed-format protocol** - Weak-signal modes where you can't add length, use this proposed method:

**During operation:**
- Station transmits normal FT8 (unchanged)
- Software signs each transmission locally
- Signatures stored in ADIF log with custom fields

**Log upload (users already do this):**
- Upload ADIF to QRZ, LoTW, ClubLog, etc.
- Includes signature fields in ADIF
- Services store callsign + signature + timestamp

**Verification (offline or online):**
- Import other stations' ADIF logs
- Software verifies signatures against public keys
- Shows verified/disputed contacts in log

**Database Architecture - Central registry:**
- **If online:** Callsign → Public Key mapping
- Station publishes signature for each transmission
- Other stations query database to verify
- Similar to how PSK Reporter works

### Kernel Keyring as Key Source for gr-openssl
```python
from gnuradio import gr, blocks, crypto, linux_crypto

# Create flowgraph
tb = gr.top_block()

# Load key from kernel keyring
key_source = linux_crypto.kernel_keyring_source(key_id=12345)

# Use with gr-openssl
cipher_desc = crypto.sym_ciph_desc("aes-256-cbc", key, iv)
encryptor = crypto.sym_enc(cipher_desc)

# Connect: keyring -> openssl encryption
tb.connect(key_source, encryptor)
```

### Hardware Security Module with gr-nacl
```python
from gnuradio import gr, nacl, linux_crypto

# Create flowgraph  
tb = gr.top_block()

# Load key from Nitrokey
nitrokey_source = linux_crypto.nitrokey_interface(slot=1)

# Use with gr-nacl
encryptor = nacl.encrypt_secret("nitrokey_key")

# Connect: nitrokey -> nacl encryption
tb.connect(nitrokey_source, encryptor)
```

### Brainpool Elliptic Curve Cryptography
```python
from gr_linux_crypto.crypto_helpers import CryptoHelpers

crypto = CryptoHelpers()

# Generate Brainpool key pair
private_key, public_key = crypto.generate_brainpool_keypair('brainpoolP256r1')

# ECDH key exchange
# Alice generates key pair
alice_private, alice_public = crypto.generate_brainpool_keypair('brainpoolP256r1')

# Bob generates key pair
bob_private, bob_public = crypto.generate_brainpool_keypair('brainpoolP256r1')

# Both compute shared secret
alice_secret = crypto.brainpool_ecdh(alice_private, bob_public)
bob_secret = crypto.brainpool_ecdh(bob_private, alice_public)
# alice_secret == bob_secret

# Derive encryption key from shared secret using HKDF
salt = crypto.generate_random_key(16)
info = b'gnuradio-encryption-key-v1'
encryption_key = crypto.derive_key_hkdf(alice_secret, salt=salt, info=info, length=32)

# ECDSA signing and verification
message = "Message to sign"
signature = crypto.brainpool_sign(message, private_key, hash_algorithm='sha256')
is_valid = crypto.brainpool_verify(message, signature, public_key, hash_algorithm='sha256')

# Key serialization
public_pem = crypto.serialize_brainpool_public_key(public_key)
private_pem = crypto.serialize_brainpool_private_key(private_key)
loaded_public = crypto.load_brainpool_public_key(public_pem)
loaded_private = crypto.load_brainpool_private_key(private_pem)
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libkeyutils-dev \
    gnuradio-dev \
    gnuradio-runtime \
    cmake \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    python3-dev \
    python3-pip

# Check GNU Radio version (optional - only needed if build fails)
pkg-config --modversion gnuradio-runtime

# If your distribution's GNU Radio packages are too old (< 3.10.12.0),
# upgrade using the GNU Radio PPA:
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnuradio/gnuradio-releases
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt upgrade gnuradio gnuradio-dev

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install existing crypto modules
sudo apt-get install gr-openssl gr-nacl

# Optional: Install additional crypto libraries
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libsodium-dev
```

### Step 2: Build the Module

**Option A: Manual Build (Recommended)**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/gr-linux-crypto

# Create and enter build directory
mkdir -p build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

# Build (use all CPU cores)
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Option B: Using the Build Script**

The `build.sh` script automates the CMake configuration and build process:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/gr-linux-crypto

# Run the build script (this runs cmake and make automatically)
./build.sh
```

**Note:** The build script creates the `build` directory, configures CMake, and builds the module. After running `build.sh`, you still need to install from the `build` directory (see Step 3 below).

### Step 3: Install the Module

**Important:** You must run `make install` from the `build` directory, not from the project root.

```bash
# Make sure you're in the build directory
cd build

# Install (requires sudo)
# If you get "getcwd: Fila eller mappa finnes ikke" error, use:
sudo make -C $(pwd) install
# Or use the absolute path:
sudo make -C /path/to/gr-linux-crypto/build install

# Standard installation (if the above error doesn't occur):
sudo make install

# Update library cache (required after installation)
sudo ldconfig
```

**Note:** If `sudo make install` fails with a `getcwd()` error, this is a known issue with GNU Make when run under sudo. Use `sudo make -C $(pwd) install` instead, which explicitly sets the working directory before make runs.

### Step 3a: Uninstall the Module (Optional)

To remove the installed module:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the build directory
cd build

# Uninstall (requires sudo)
sudo make uninstall

# Update library cache after uninstallation
sudo ldconfig
```

**Note:** The uninstall target removes all files that were installed by `make install`, including:
- Library files (`libgnuradio-linux-crypto.so*`)
- Header files (`include/gnuradio/linux_crypto/*.h`)
- Python bindings (`linux_crypto_python*.so`)
- GRC block definitions (`share/gnuradio/grc/blocks/*.yml`)
- Example scripts (`share/gr-linux-crypto/examples/*.py`)
- Documentation (if installed)

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if library was installed
ldconfig -p | grep linux-crypto

# Test Python import
python3 -c "from gnuradio import linux_crypto; print('Module installed successfully!')"
```

**Note:** If you get "No rule to make target 'install'" error, you're likely in the wrong directory. Make sure you're in the `build` directory before running `sudo make install`.

## Important Note

This module depends on the **libkeyutils-dev** package, which provides the development headers for the keyutils library. This package is required for:

- Kernel keyring operations (`keyctl` system calls)
- Key management functions
- Secure key storage integration

Without this package, the module will fail to compile due to missing `keyutils.h` header file.

## Cryptographic Operations Overview

This module provides two distinct types of cryptographic operations:

### 1. Encryption (AES block)
- **Purpose:** Confidentiality - hides data from unauthorized parties
- **Does NOT authenticate** who sent the data
- Uses symmetric keys (same key for encrypt/decrypt)

### 2. Signing & Key Exchange (Brainpool ECC block)
- **ECDSA Signing:** Proves authenticity and integrity
  - **Important:** Signing does NOT encrypt! Signed data is still readable by anyone
  - Use signing to prove "this came from me and wasn't modified"
- **ECDH Key Exchange:** Securely establish shared secrets
- **Key Generation:** Create public/private key pairs

### Common Use Pattern
1. Use ECDH to establish a shared AES key
2. Use AES to encrypt your signal data
3. Use ECDSA to sign the encrypted data (or metadata)

## Supported Ciphers and Algorithms

- **Poly1305** - for ChaCha20
- HMAC (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512)

**Note:** For additional algorithms (RSA, more ECC curves, etc.), use **gr-openssl** which provides comprehensive OpenSSL support.

### Battery-Friendly Cryptography

For battery-powered devices (portable radios, embedded systems, mobile SDR platforms), choosing the right cryptographic algorithms can significantly impact battery life. The recommended combination for maximum battery efficiency is:

**Recommended: BrainpoolP256r1 + ChaCha20Poly1305**

#### Why This Combination is Battery-Friendly

**1. ChaCha20Poly1305 (from gr-nacl)**
- **Software-optimized**: Designed for efficient software implementation without requiring special hardware instructions
- **ARM-friendly**: Provides excellent performance on ARM processors (common in battery-powered devices)
- **No hardware dependency**: Unlike AES, which benefits from AES-NI instructions (Intel/AMD), ChaCha20 works efficiently in pure software
- **Lower power consumption**: Software implementations consume less power than hardware-accelerated instructions that require specialized CPU features
- **High throughput**: Even without hardware acceleration, ChaCha20 achieves high encryption speeds

**2. BrainpoolP256r1 (from gr-linux-crypto)**
- **Lightweight ECC**: Smaller key sizes compared to RSA (256 bits vs. 2048+ bits for equivalent security)
- **Efficient key exchange**: ECDH operations are computationally efficient
- **Battery-conscious**: Fewer CPU cycles = less power consumption during key exchange operations

#### How to Use This Combination

```python
from gr_linux_crypto.crypto_helpers import CryptoHelpers
from gnuradio import nacl

# Step 1: ECDH Key Exchange using BrainpoolP256r1 (gr-linux-crypto)
crypto = CryptoHelpers()

# Alice generates Brainpool key pair
alice_private, alice_public = crypto.generate_brainpool_keypair('brainpoolP256r1')

# Bob generates Brainpool key pair  
bob_private, bob_public = crypto.generate_brainpool_keypair('brainpoolP256r1')

# Both compute shared secret via ECDH
alice_secret = crypto.brainpool_ecdh(alice_private, bob_public)
bob_secret = crypto.brainpool_ecdh(bob_private, alice_public)
# alice_secret == bob_secret

# Step 2: Derive encryption key from shared secret using HKDF
salt = crypto.generate_random_key(16)
info = b'battery-friendly-encryption-v1'
encryption_key = crypto.derive_key_hkdf(
    alice_secret, 
    salt=salt, 
    info=info, 
    length=32  # 256-bit key for ChaCha20
)

# Step 3: Encrypt with ChaCha20Poly1305 (gr-nacl)
# Note: Consult gr-nacl documentation for exact API calls
# encrypted = nacl.encrypt_chacha20poly1305(message, encryption_key, nonce)
```

#### Comparison with Alternatives

**AES (Hardware-Accelerated)**
- **Pros**: Very fast when AES-NI instructions are available
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires hardware acceleration for best performance
  - Inefficient in software-only implementations
  - Higher power consumption on devices without AES-NI (ARM, older CPUs)
  - Not ideal for battery-powered devices without hardware acceleration

**AES (Software-Only)**
- **Pros**: Widely supported
- **Cons**: Significantly slower than ChaCha20 in software, higher power consumption

**RSA Key Exchange**
- **Pros**: Widely supported
- **Cons**: 
  - Much larger key sizes (2048+ bits vs. 256 bits)
  - More computationally intensive
  - Higher power consumption
  - Not recommended for battery-powered devices

**X25519 (from gr-nacl)**
- **Alternative to Brainpool**: Also efficient for key exchange
- **Pros**: Often slightly faster than Brainpool on some platforms
- **Note**: Both X25519 and BrainpoolP256r1 are good choices; Brainpool provides algorithm diversity (non-NSA-influenced)

#### Best Practices for Battery-Powered Devices

1. **Use ECDH for Key Exchange**: Prefer elliptic curve cryptography (Brainpool or X25519) over RSA
2. **Use ChaCha20 for Encryption**: Prefer ChaCha20Poly1305 over AES when hardware acceleration isn't available
3. **Minimize Key Exchanges**: Establish keys once, reuse for multiple encrypted sessions
4. **Cache Keys Securely**: Use kernel keyring (from gr-linux-crypto) to store derived keys securely
5. **Profile Your Device**: Test actual power consumption; results may vary based on CPU architecture

#### When to Use Each

**Use BrainpoolP256r1 + ChaCha20Poly1305 when:**
- Running on battery-powered devices (portable radios, embedded systems, mobile platforms)
- CPU lacks AES-NI hardware acceleration (ARM processors, older x86 CPUs)
- Maximum battery life is critical
- Algorithm diversity is desired (avoiding NSA-influenced algorithms)

**Use AES-GCM when:**
- Running on modern Intel/AMD CPUs with AES-NI support
- Hardware acceleration is available and verified
- Power consumption is less of a concern (desktop/server applications)

**Note**: This combination requires both `gr-linux-crypto` (for Brainpool ECDH) and `gr-nacl` (for ChaCha20Poly1305). Both modules work together seamlessly for battery-efficient cryptography.

## Cryptographic Algorithm Background

### Cryptographic Ciphers Influenced by the NSA

The National Security Agency (NSA) has been involved in various cryptographic standards and algorithms. Here are some ciphers likely influenced by the NSA:

| Cipher | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) | Endorsed by the NSA for federal applications, widely used for secure data encryption. |
| **DSA** (Digital Signature Algorithm) | Developed under NSA auspices, commonly used for digital signatures. |
| **SHA** (Secure Hash Algorithm) | NSA has influenced multiple versions, with SHA-1 and SHA-2 being widely used and critiqued for certain vulnerabilities. |
| **Skipjack** | Created by the NSA for the Clipper chip, aimed at secure voice communications. |
| **KASUMI** | A block cipher influenced by NSA standards, utilized in 3G cellular networks. |

### Cryptographic Ciphers NOT Influenced by the NSA

Several algorithms developed independently of the NSA are widely used:

| Cipher | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **RSA** (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) | An academic standard widely used for secure key exchange, not influenced by NSA. |
| **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** | Developed independently, focusing on secure and efficient cryptographic solutions. |
| **ChaCha20** | Designed by Daniel Bernstein for speed and security, with no NSA involvement. |
| **Twofish** | An AES finalist created by Bruce Schneier, independently developed. |
| **Serpent** | Another AES finalist, also created without direct NSA influence. |
| **Brainpool** | A suite of elliptic curves (e.g., Brainpool P-256) developed without NSA influence, though it is implemented in many cryptographic systems. |

**Summary:** While several ciphers have ties to the NSA, such as AES and SHA, there are many robust alternatives like RSA, ChaCha20, and Brainpool, developed independently. Understanding these distinctions helps in choosing secure cryptographic solutions.

### Known Scandals Involving NSA and Cryptography

Several scandals and controversies have surrounded the NSA's involvement in cryptography, revealing concerns about security, privacy, and possible manipulation of standards. Here are some key incidents:

| Incident | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **NSA's Involvement in Dual_EC_DRBG** | This random number generator was adopted by NIST but later revealed to be potentially compromised by the NSA, raising suspicions of backdoors. |
| **PRISM** | Exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013, revealing that the NSA collects data from major tech companies, including communications encrypted using NSA-influenced standards. |
| **Clapper's Misleading Testimony** | Then-Director James Clapper's testimony before Congress in 2013 was scrutinized after revelations about extensive surveillance practices came to light. |
| **Clipper Chip** | Launched in the early 1990s, it aimed to provide secure phone communication but faced backlash due to mandatory key escrow, which many viewed as a significant privacy infringement. |
| **SHA-1 Deprecation** | The SHA-1 hashing algorithm, once endorsed by the NSA, was later found vulnerable, leading to its deprecation and questions about the NSA's early assessments of its security. |

**Summary:** These incidents highlight significant concerns regarding the NSA's influence in cryptography and the potential implications for security and privacy. The revelations have fostered a mistrust of cryptographic standards and increased the demand for independent auditing and verification of cryptographic algorithms.
